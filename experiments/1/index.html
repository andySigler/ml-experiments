            <p>
                As a first experiment with ML, I've made a simple visualization of a DCGAN's ouptut, trained on the MNIST dataset of handwritten numbers.

                I goals for this project where to:
                <ol>
                    <li>Create and train a DCGAN from "scratch" in python</li>
                    <li>Export that trained model to a webpage</li>
                    <li>Use the model for real-time interaction (of some sort)</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p>
                <a href="https://github.com/andySigler/ml-experiments/tree/master/experiments/1/python/dcgan.ipynb">The python script used to create and train the DCGAN can be here</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The UI for this webpage shows both the DCGAN's input and output values. The green circles represent each of the unique input features (most commonly "noise", but I wanted interaction), and the black circles are the DCGAN's predicted output.

                This experiment was very useful for me, especially for getting a better intuition of latent space and interacting with generative models.
