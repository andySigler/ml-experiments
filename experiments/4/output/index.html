                    For this small project, I wanted to focus on hyper-parameter tuning. As I've been teaching myself Tensorflow, I've been building models based on what I've seen in tutorials, but I've never actually analyzed how my hyper-parameters were affecting the model's performance.

                    This experiment uses a basic convolutional autoencoder for performing principle component analysis on images of The Simpsons faces. However, instead of guessing hyper-parameters and then overfitting, I build some methods for iteratively training with different parameters, and analyzing the results on validation data.
