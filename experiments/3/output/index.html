                <h2>The Goal</h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to make a system that can copy how I doodle in my notebooks. Below are some pictures from my notebooks over the years, showing how I doodle.
                </p>

                <p>
                    You'll notice that, generally, I draw random lines, and I try not to overlap those lines. There are also some common angles and shapes that I subconsciously make.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've made small programs in the past that try to achieve this programmatically, however it always looked a little too robotic.

                <h2>Getting Some Data</h2>
                <p>
                    To start with, I needed to create a system for recording my doodling style. I created a program that records my drawings in an HTML5 Canvas, and then drew for a couple hours while listening to podcasts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can see some of my drawings below. Press the "Random" button to see one of my doodles being drawn.

                <h2>Training the Model</h2>
                <p>
                    I used a Python notebook to train the models using Tensorflow 2.0-beta.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The training data (my drawings) were loaded and sent through the following processes:
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Compress total points, to keep same shape with less data
                            <ul>
                                <li style="margin-top: 5px">This allowed me to keep the final model as small as possible, while still being able to generate recognizable shapes</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li style="margin-top: 5px">
                            Synthetically create new drawings (more data!), through:
                            <ul>
                                <li style="margin-top: 5px">Rotating each drawing four times at 90 degrees</li>
                                <li style="margin-top: 5px">Scaling each drawing down in size and transposing</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li style="margin-top: 5px">
                            Creating training X/Y pairs, for both the simple autoencoders, and the RNN models
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The final model is a combination of three sequential models:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Convolutional Encoder</li>
                        <li>LSTM</li>
                        <li>Mixture Density Network</li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the diagram below, I tried to demonstrate the sequence of how I trained each model independently. Training each sub-model separately seemed to help the training process learn faster and more accurately than training end-to-end.
                </p>

                <h2>Did It Work?</h2>
                <p>
                    Not really, but I can say that after working on this model for a couple weeks, I learned quite a lot about how to make it work better.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I think some things that could make it better are:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Using training drawings that are <strong>NOT</strong> just my random doodles. Random doodles are hard for me (a human) to tell apart from just noise when a ML model is generating them...</li>
                        <li>More training time. After I was about to give up, I found that if I simply train the final MDN-RNN network longs, it started looking better</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
